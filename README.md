# Quantum Computing with KushagraS
Packages and libraries for Quantum Computing using python.

## What is Quantum Computing
This is a repository for Quantum Computing using python. Computing Computing is a emerging field of Computer Science which uses the laws and properties of Quantum systems to solve problems. Quantum Computers are totally different from the computers which we see in our daya to day lives, unlike a classical bit which can either be 0 or 1 at any point in time, Quantum bit or qubit can be in a superposition of 0 and 1, which imples that a qubit can be both 0 and 1 at the same time with some probability of being 0 and some probability of being 1. A quantum computer uses a properties of Quantum Physics to carry out operations, some of them are listed below :-
```
1. Quantum Superposition
2. Quantum Entanglement
3. Quantum Interference
etc.
```
You can search the internet more elaborated and revelent explanation of quantum computing. If you still do not understand I will soon give links of e-books for Quantum Computing.

## Aim of skushagra/quantum
Mainly programs for quantum computers are written using the library Qiskit, the main aim of skushagra/quantum is to create libraries and packages which further shorten the code hence making your code more compact and efficient.

## Softwares to be used
The code given in the repo can be run on any device locally with python and qiskit installed. For the ease of the user it is recomended to run the given code on Quantum lab of your IBM Quantum Experience account, still the decision of how and where to run the code remains in the hands of the user.

## Circuits for applications
##### For 4 qubit systems.
#### Bernstine-Vazirani Algorithm
![](circuit_pictures/Bern-Vazi.jpg)
#### Out_0
![](circuit_pictures/Out_0.jpg)
#### Quantum Teleportation Algorithm
![](circuit_pictures/quantum_teleportation.jpg)
#### Quantum Coins
This game has a circuit similar to the Out_0 Algorithm but remains of fixed length i.e. 2 Quantum Bits and 2 Classical Bits.

## KushagraS on IBMQ

I personally joined IBMQ in September 2020, though I must say that I am not yet officially a part of IBM's Quantum Team, I hope one day I will be. As of Dec 1, 2020 I am currently enrolled in a year long course on Quantum Computing which is sponsered by IBM called QubitbyQubit by The Coding School. To know more about me follow this link(https://sites.google.com/view/skushagra).
